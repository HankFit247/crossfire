## Security Checklist

One of the goals of the Crossfire competition is to get our future validators to get prepared and have a secure validator node setup.

Our security team has provided a security checklist for participants to follow-up before joining the Crossfire competition. It covers items regarding validator node setup, system, network; and account security. You can also run the audit script provided to make sure your system configuration is following the best practices.

We strongly recommend every participant to read and follow the steps in the checklist to get prepared.
